    <h3>Open Source</h3>

    <img src="./images/pic4.jpg" alt="">

    <p>The term <strong>"open source"</strong> refers to something people can modify and 
        share because its design is publicly accessible.</p>

    <p>The term originated in the context of software development
         to designate a specific approach to creating computer programs. 
         Today, however, <em>"open source"</em> designates a broader set of valuesâ€”what
          we call <b><i>"the open source way."</i></b> Open source projects, products, 
          or initiatives embrace and celebrate principles of open exchange, 
          collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, 
          meritocracy, and community-oriented development.</p>
